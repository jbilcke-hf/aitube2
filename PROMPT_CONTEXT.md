For some context:

our app is an AI video generation platform, where people use the frontend app (written in Flutter) to virtually "search" for video (the video synopsis and their content are generated on the fly using AI). 

Note that this uses a custom API written in Python, with a WebSockets communication.

To go back to the Flutter app, when the user open a thumbnail card after doing such generative AI search, it opens a full view for a video (with a player, title, description, chat section etc and a special search bar in the top header that allows to edit the current video's theme).
